# Builtin_led
Builtin led code for any board.....

         Circuit
This example uses the built-in LED that most Arduino boards have. This LED is connected to a digital pin and its number may vary from board type to board type. To make your life easier, we have a constant that is specified in every board descriptor file. This constant is LED_BUILTIN and allows you to control the built-in LED easily. Here is the correspondence between the constant and the digital pin.

D13 - UNO
D13 - Nano
D13 - MEGA2560
D13 - Mini
GPIO 2 - ESP8266
GPIO 2 - ESP32
